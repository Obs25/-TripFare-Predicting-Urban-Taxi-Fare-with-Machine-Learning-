# 🚕 TripFare: NYC Taxi Fare & Driver Hotspot Predictor
## 📝 Overview

This project uses a real-world NYC taxi dataset to build two machine learning models:
1.  **Fare Predictor (Regression):** Accurately estimates taxi fares for passengers.
2.  **Hotspot Finder (Classification):** Helps drivers locate areas with high earning potential.

The final models are deployed in an interactive web application built with **Streamlit**, featuring clickable maps for an intuitive user experience.
